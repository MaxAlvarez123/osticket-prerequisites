<p>
Step 1

- In order for PHP Manager to be installed you'll first have to enable CGI within ISS. 
This feature allows your computer to serve a website which is what osTicket runs on.

- To test out and see if you enable CGI correctly you can use the following IP Address 127.0.0.1 and if it shows the defualt ISS website
its turned on correctly. 

- How to find CGI: Control panel -> Programs -> Turn Window Features on or off -> Internet Information Services -> World Wide Web 
-> Application Development Features -> CGI.

<p>
Step2

After having downlaoded all of the necessary application in the "List of Prerequisites" you will now register PHP within IIS.

This is done by opening IIS as a administrator.

Opening PHP manager and then selecting the PHP folder which has all of the unzipped contents from before.

Step 4

- Within IIS Go to Sites -> Default -> osTicket and on the right click on "Browse *:80‚Äù

- It will take you to the osTicket intallation page and there are still some red X's beside some extenstions which means we
need to enable them in order for us to use all of the features.

<p>
Step 6

- Next we will rename the ost-sampleconfig.php file to ost-config.php which can be found from C:\inetpub\wwwroot\osTicket\include\ost-config.php

- Next within ost-config.php we will assign new permissions within this file.
    
    - Disable Inheritance -> Remove All
    
    - New Permission -> Everyone -> All
 
- Finally, go back to the osTicket installation page and hit continue and set up osTicket the way you want it.
